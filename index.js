// - When we started out, we assigned ID numbers sequentially to new users, so our
// first user's ID is `1`, second is `2`, third is `3`, and so on. That was fine
// when we were a fledgling company, but, now that we have millions of active
// users, it would be easier if all of our user IDs were the same length. We'd like
// the IDs to start from `1000000001` (one billion and one) instead of `1`. Create
// a variable named `newID` that adds `1000000000` to the value in `oldID`, which
// you shouldn't define â€” it will be provided for you in the test suite.

var newID
return result 1000000000 + oldID



/*
Variables defined in the test suite:
- oldID
- currentAge

You should NOT try to redefine any of the above variables.
